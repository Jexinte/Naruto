# API_NARUTO_VUEJS


# Overview 30/06/2022

I'm re-learning Nodejs and I was wondering how to best integrate my knowledge and obviously practice was the right answer however I didn't want to go on any project where I wouldn't enjoy building my API so an idea came to my mind.

I love the work of Masashi Kishimoto known as "Naruto" and I simply said to myself that I could create cards of characters on which at the click you could have a small overview of the history of the characters and also have the possibility to display only the characters according to their villages.

The API is not responsive it was not the goal the important for me was to have fun and it's done so I can continue my learning! Who knows, maybe soon I'll add the possibility to create your own character card of the same universe?

# Overview 24/07/2022

Few weeks have past since I start to learning nodejs again and I'm learning vuejs too for another project and I thought again that I have to put what I've learn in practice so I decided to rewrite my API NARUTO with vuejs architecture and it's pretty fine I also redesign the API on frontend they're is not a lot of change I just want to keep it very simple so here the result.

### How to use it

- Use git clone
- Go in the backend folder and launch npm install
- You have to set your connection to mysql database with Sequelize an .env example have been provide
- Launch npm install an the frontend folder then run the server with the following command without brackets :
    -  ./node_modules/.bin/vue-cli-service serve

- Then launch nodemon and backend folder no matter the port as long it's not on 8080 port

# Overview 12/01/2024
About 2 years after the creation of this project, I had gained enough skills to be able to update it, so in order to create automatic processes such as project configuration and the implementation of a quality process, I decided to update some of my projects to the language I'll be working with throughout my future career, which is php.

The framework used to update the project is Symfony.
